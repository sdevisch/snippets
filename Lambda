# Lambda
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp
A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
lambda arguments : expression

x = lambda a: a + 10
print(x(5))

x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c
print(x(5, 6, 2))


def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n

# pass n to myfunc
# mydoubler is still a function
# as
mydoubler = myfunc(2)

# pass a to mydoubler
print(mydoubler(11))
