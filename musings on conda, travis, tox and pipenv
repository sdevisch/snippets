I often wonder... how do conda, travis, tox, pipenv and the associated files interact.

This post tries to demystify some of the inner workings.
I'll add more over time as things gel.

## How do these things differ and work together
Travis sets up the python environment; divides tests up in stages; installs python, pip, tox, etc.
Tox automates testing.

## Sequence of events
Travis.yml: travis coordinates everything. Configuration through travis.yml. Travis calls tox.
Tox.ini: tox launches pytest
Setup.cfg drives what to test and what not to test


## pipfile vs. setup
Pipfile: for applications that are deployed or publicly distributed in installers, use Pipfile
Setup.py: for applications that are distributed through git, put dependencies in install_requires
"pipenv install -e ." Make Pipfile depend on setup.py by running pipenv install '-e .'   # don't forget the dot
Project dependencies - in contrast to environment dependencies should be added to setup.py.
